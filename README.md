# Epilepsy Seizure Prediction with Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks
A solution of https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction using Convolutional Neural Network.  
The result is not deterministic due to the limition of tensorflow. So the best way to reproduc the result is using the processed data and the weights we provid. You can download the preprocessed data from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bvfsbac43d1aeg3/AABLcM-uGCsz58-Bt399Thaaa?dl=0 and the weights are in the weights folder.
